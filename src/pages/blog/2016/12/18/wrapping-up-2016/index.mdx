The year is almost over. A friend of mine, [Esteban](https://twitter.com/esttorhe), published a [blog post](https://estebantorr.es/blog/2016/12/16/Wrapping-up-2017/), wrapping up his year and it inspired me to do the same.

Starting from my personal life, I unexpectedly met Maria Jos√©, my girlfriend. We were friends in the high school, and we hadn't talked or a long time. Nevertheless, the world is sometimes not that big, and you don't know when and where you can meet a person again. The fate brought us together; we met in Budapest and magic came out. After some flights between Berlin and Budapest I decided to move to Budapest, so I'll start living there from January. I'll be working for SoundCloud, the company I joined in October 2015. So far, it's been the company I've been working the longest time with. It has a very inspiring culture, and it's a good place to grow as an engineer because of its values, people and product. In 2016 I moved to a new team, Core Clients, working this time on tools for other developers.

In 2016 I've also attended many conferences, speaking about a project that we're currently developing at SoundCloud, _"Framework Oriented Programming"_ or _"Apps Modularization"_. All the slides are published on my [SpeakerDeck](http://speakerdeck.com/pepibumur) account. I spoke at the following conferences:

- [CodeMotion Amsterdam](http://amsterdam2016.codemotionworld.com/)
- [iOSCon](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7598-ioscon-2016-the-conference-for-ios-and-swift-developers)
- [CMD+U](http://www.cmduconf.com/)
- [NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com/)
- [Mobiconf](http://www.2016.mobiconf.org/)
- [Mobilization](http://2016.mobilization.pl/)

I had the opportunity to meet **world-class engineers and people**, like [Esteban Torres](https://twitter.com/esttorhe), who I have the pleasure to work with. [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/benjaminencz) who I met at iOSCon, I still remember the very inspiring talk that we had in our way to the airport. [Roy](https://twitter.com/marmelroy), whose open source contributions were part of most of my projects. [Boris](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho) and his *#yatusabes*üç∑ and [Marius](https://twitter.com/mrackwitz).

I **travelled** around Europe more than what I used to. Living in Berlin makes it easier since you can be in another country in just a few hours. I took the flights on Friday evening, and I flew back on Monday morning. I went straight from the airport to the office. Budapest, Granada, Malaga, Sevilla, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Scotland, London, Stockholm, San Sebastian, Logro√±o, Viena, Praga, Greece, Slovakia, Krakow, Switzerland, Verona and Morroco. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2218121082/mochilo.jpg) is how my mother sees me after 2017 full of trips.

I started a **newsletter** and quit it after almost ten issues. Thanks to it, I had interesting discussions with [Raimon](https://twitter.com/wolffan) since we had similar concerns about the topics I talked about. I kept writing articles. One of them, [In a world...](/2016/11/16/in-a-world.html) became very controversial in the iOS and Android communities and had a lot of retweets and comments on the social networks. Another one, [Micro Features Architecture for iOS](https://blog.caramba.io/micro-features-architecture-for-ios-f81ca18f03ac) turned out to be attractive to the community and got almost 100 likes on Medium.

I published on a new **spare-time** project with [Isaac](https://twitter.com/saky), GitDo, and stop its development to focus on a new project with Sergi and Ana, [Caramba](http://caramba.io). We'd develop and design our apps as we did when we started as developers. So far we've developed multiple apps, Open Source projects, and written numerous articles that we've shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/carambalabs) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@caramba) respectively.

I've tried to read more this year. Among other **books**, I've read: _Peopleware_, _Tribe_, _Who moved my cheese?_, _Drive - The surprising truth about what motivates us_. I started using [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com) to track them and get recommendations based on my reads and my friends' lectures. You can find me as @pepibumur on the platform.

## 2017 - What's coming?

Languages have been a challenge for me. I want to keep improving my English this year, and try with a new language, which will most likely be **German** _(yes... now that I moved to Budapest)_. I also want to learn a new programming skill. My focus, since I became a developer, has been iOS. I learnt Objective-C, and later Swift. However, when it's about the web I know just a little. While I know how to develop and app from scratch and ship it to production, I don't know how to do the equivalent with a website. I'd like to be able to code a frontend _(HTML and CSS)_ and include some client _Javascript_ logic. Moreover, Swift can be used in server environments and macOS applications. I'd like to explore Swift on the server side, implementing a backend on Swift, and learn about _AppKit_ and learn apps development for macOS.

I'll keep writing and sharing my learnings in the open. I'll be in Budapest most of 2017, but I might consider moving somewhere else... **Looking forward to starting 2017.**
