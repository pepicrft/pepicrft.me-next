Have you ever used programming paradigms like [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) or [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)? Have you tried the revolutionary approach to model how the state is contained and flows in your app, [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)? I find it great that companies and open source organizations try to solve issues that we developers, have to face on a daily basis by introducing new concepts in the industry. We'll see more of those coming, and what it's cool nowadays won't be in a matter of months/years. Do you think reactive programming is the coolest thing ever? Let's see in a few years if it was the coolest thing ever, or there was still space for even cooler alternatives.

If there's something I've learned in my short career as a software engineer is that there's no perfect paradigm, pattern, or architecture and that it all depends on our problems or particular needs. Something that is convenient for other projects and teams might not be convenient for us. _Have you worked on a code base where someone introduced a new concept/library, like a Reactive programming library, and you ended up very concerned when that thing spread all over the codebase?_ There are libraries that we introduce and that are isolated, we can easily abstract them with an interface, but there are others that as soon as we use them, they spread very quickly across the codebase. They are like viruses, and as soon as you open them the door, they have everything they need to spread around.

> I have nothing against the paradigms mentioned above. I think each paradigm that changes the way we code should be used consciously, and we should regularly evaluate if the choice we made works out for us and that is not becoming a burden that we need to carry on.

I wondered why those elements end up behaving like viruses. There must be something, in the team or the project, that helps them spread that fast. I think the reason why that happens is that it brings up a dilemma to developers when they need to work with code that already includes the virus. **They need to decide between choosing the consistent solution, or the convenient one**, and most of the times we lean towards the consistent solution. You'll understand this better with a couple of examples.
