In my effort of moving away form Gmail, I took the opportunity to set up my new email account in such a way that I could better organize my work on GitHub.

There's a feature that GitHub has never had and that I'd find very useful, workspaces. I used to look at the notifications to know the things I should focus on. If you are part of multiple organizations, all those notifications show up in the same place. As a result, when I open the notifications page to plan the open source work, I end up looking at work stuff and the other way around.

**Luckily, most email providers offer defining rules for emails.** With rules, you can match certain emails that you receive, and define an action for them, for example archiving or deleting.

Thanks to rules I was able to have workspaces for GitHub right on my inbox. This is what I did:

1. Add an email address per workspace to your GitHub account.
2. Configure the notifications per organization and forward them to the right email account.
3. Create a folder per workspace. In my case it was "shopify", "work", and "tuist".
4. Define a rule where you match the recepient with the emails above and send the email to the right folder.

Simple, isn't it? With this little tweak I can access a notifications-free GitHub, focus on my work, and check the notifications on my email when I need to plan the work.
