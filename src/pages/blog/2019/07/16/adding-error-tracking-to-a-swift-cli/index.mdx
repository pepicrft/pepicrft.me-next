Software is written by imperfect creatures,
humans,
and as a consequence the imperfection manifests in the software in the shape of bugs.
Languages like Swift can help us write free-of-bugs software,
but they'll never be able to help us get rid of them entirely.

When bugs happen,
it's crucial to be notified automatically with the right information that helps us debug and fix the bug quickly.
That's why platforms like [Crashlytics](https://try.crashlytics.com/) or [Sentry](https://sentry.io) exist.
They provide an SDK to add to your projects that collect handled and unhandled errors and report them to a web service.
If you are an iOS developer,
you are most likely familiar with them.

[Tuist](https://tuist.io) didn't have error reporting,
making it hard to know when errors happened and why.
Moreover,
we were relying on users to know about bugs.
If they didn't create GitHub issues,
we had no way to know that they were facing bugs while using the tool.

I recently worked on adding error reporting to Tuist,
which turned out not to be an straightforward task.
This blog post is a summary of all the steps that I followed.
Developers building command line tools using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) might find this blog post useful.

## Download the dynamic framework

The first thing that we need to do is pull the dynamic framework of your error tracking platform.
Most services provide a dynamic framework,
if not,
you can ask them for it.
[Here's](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases) for instance the list of Sentry releases,
which contain the dynamic framework attached to it.

> Setting up error tracking with a static framework it's also possible, but in this post I'll focus on the dynamic approach.

Place the framework under `./Frameworks/` _(e.g. `./Frameworks/Sentry.framework`)_.

## Generate an Xcode project that links against the framework

Once we have the framework,
we need to tell the Swift Package Manager to set up the generated Xcode project to use it.
Although there isn't a public API that we can use from our project's `Package.swift` file,
there's an undocumented API that we can leverage.
Create a file, `MyTool.xcconfig`,
where `MyTool` is the name of your tool,
and add the following content:

```
LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) $(SRCROOT)/Frameworks
FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS=$(inherited) $(SRCROOT)/Frameworks
OTHER_LDFLAGS = $(inherited) -framework "Sentry"
```

- **LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS**: Defines a list of directories where the dynamic linker can look up the linked frameworks. We are adding `$(SRCROOT)/Frameworks`, which is the `Frameworks` directory relative to the path where the generated Xcode project is.
- **FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS**: Defines the directories that contain the frameworks to be linked during the compilation process.
- **OTHER_LDFLAGS:** With this setting we include the linker flag `-framework Sentry` to link against the Sentry framework. You'll need to replace Sentry with the name of your framework.

With the file `MyTool.xcconfig` in the project directory, we can run the following command:

```
swift package generate-xcodeproj --xcconfig-overrides MyTool.xcconfig
```
