Today,
I decided to move all [Angle](https://angle.dev)'s dependencies that were defined as [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) Pods to Swift Packages.
It was my first-hand experience with Xcode's integration with the Swift Package Manager so here are my thoughts:

- I had no issues. I went through all the dependencies, got their URL, and added the dependency from the linking frameworks build phase. Xcode was able to resolve the dependencies, list the linkable targets, and configure the project seamlessly. I barely had to touch anything on the project.
- Some Pods had not `Package.swift` file so I ended up using [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage) for those. I compiled a `.framework` file and then dragged and drop the framework to the project.
- After moving all the dependencies, I deleted the workspace generated by CocoaPods and all the references from the project. The project built successfully, and ran without any issues.

[Apple](https://apple.com) did a really good job here.

By the way,
I'm very excited to continue working on Angle,
another side project in which I'm involved and to which I couldn't contribute much because I was mainly focused on [Tuist](https://tuist.io).
Last weekend I worked on creating the [documentation website](https://angle.dev/documentation) in Gatsby.
It already contains the getting started steps in case you want to give it a try.
