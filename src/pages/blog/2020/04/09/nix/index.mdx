At [Shopify](https://shopify.com),
the dev-infra team has been working on using [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) from one of our internal tools,
`dev`.
The tool is responsible for setting up the developers' environment,
as well as providing a standard CLI for automation for projects like Rails, iOS, or Android apps.
As you probably know,
setting things up in a developer's environment is wild —
you don't know what to expect.
It's hard to set things up deterministically,
and reproduce one environment into another.
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for instance,
tries to do as best as it can,
but since it treats the environment as a global space in which dumping things,
alike a singleton class that _anyone_ can modify,
that often results in hard-to-debug errors.

The first time that I heard about Nix was on [this blog post](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/continuous-integration-for-ios-with-nix-and-buildkite-ef5b36c5292d) from Pinterest,
but it didn't catch my attention until now.
I started reading about it and watching some internal videos that [Burke](https://twitter.com/burkelibbey) is creating to evangelize the idea.
The more I read about it, the more amazed I am with the idea.
These are the ideas that struck me:

- Environments are defined in directories with symlinks to other directories that represent nodes of a dependency graph. Each node has a unique hash based on its content, the input, and the output.
- Every modification of your environment is tracked and can be rolled-back akin to how [Git](https://git-scm.com/) works.
- If one of those nodes needs to be built locally, the output artifacts can be shared remotely and pulled from other environments to speed things up.
- The dependency graph extends to components that are very core to the system.
  That prevents, among others, that macOS upgrades break the user environment.
- You can pull and run a package without polluting the environment.
- Nix provides its own expressive language that prevents developers from doing operations that might introduce side effects.

I'll keep reading about it.
I think [Tuist](https://tuist.io) could benefit from some of its ideas.
For example, the idea of minimizing the IO and side effects,
as well as the way it models the dependency graph.

I hope everyone is safe in these difficult times. Stay at home!
