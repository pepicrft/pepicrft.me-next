I feel it really hard to work these days without feeling anxious.
A Slack ping here,
an interesting tweet there,
some emails to answer,
articles to read that are piling up...
With that set up,
not only I can't concentrate,
but I deliver poorly.
All my mental energy is disseminated and I look like a zombie at the end of the day.

To fix that, I've done the following adjustments to the way I approach spending time with computers:

- I only check social networks when I'm mentally exhausted _(i.e. at the end of the day)._
- If I think there's something worth sharing, I use [Buffer](https://buffer.com) instead of openning Twitter and be trapped by the unceasing stream of new things.
- I use to asynchronous communications over real-time ones like Slack. I'm moving Tuist's discussions to GitHub issues and a [community](https://community.tuist.io) forum. At work, we are trying to use GitHub issues and documents more.
- I reduced the Slack groups I'm part of, especially the community ones. I'm already doing my part of helping the community by building [Tuist](https://tuist.io).
- I time-box the time that I dedicate to certain tasks like reading email, answering messages on Slack, or doing open source.
- I minimize my go-to programming languages and tools and be ok with not keeping up with updates. I became a goal-oriented engineer rather than technology-enthusiastic. Swift and Ruby are just technologies that enable me to achieve certain goals.

From all of the above,
the ones that have helped me the most are **being ok with not keeping up with things**,
and **moving away from quick and unceassing communications** that happen on platforms like Twitter, or Slack.

I'm way more relieved now,
and I feel I can deliver much better things without feeling anxious at all.
