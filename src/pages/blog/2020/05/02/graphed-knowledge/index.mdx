Most of the note-taking apps that we can find out there are designed around the same organization principle: _notes are linearly organized and grouped into higher-lever abstractions that are folders._

Unfortunately, our knowledge is not linear, hence using those apps to dump our brain into the cloud requires a pre-conversion, which takes you away from your root thought and perhaps the opportunity to connect it with other thoughts and ideas.

Some people might not find this annoying, but I certainly do. The way I think is pretty much like Internet and many things in this planet work: _as a network of interconnected thoughts where the close ones have something in common_.

What I would expect from an app where I can dump my thoughts an ideas is therefore a **simple interface to build a graph where the nodes are units of knowledge or ideas.**

There are apps like [Notion](https://notion.so) that make that possible with the use of hyperlinks but the interface is fairly overwhelming. Moreover, the experience in mobile is terrible as a consequence of using a webviews.

There are also apps around the concept of mind-mapping. They provide a visual interface to modify the graph. Although that might be handy for short-term graphs, I don’t think it’s the most suitable interface for quick brain-dumps. I think the graph must exist, but **it should be an implementation detail.**

**How do I imagine the app then?** I imagine a native mobile app, meaning by native that it uses native primitives and patterns. Most of the time I’ll be in brain-dump mode, so as soon as I open it, I get a form. Moreover, I’d get a default list of labels and other ideas to connect them with.

The other mode the app would have is journey. I could get lost in the graph and revisit those notes that I left for my future self. Pretty much like Pinterest but most knowledge and ideas oriented. _Isn’t it beautiful?_

I started building it with my wife and sister-in-law. My wife will focus on envisioning and designing the product. My sister-in-law and I will do the coding part. All the projects will be open source in the GitHub organization [logosapp](https://github.com/logosapp).
