I'm avoiding opening Twitter these days.
It makes me a bit anxious receiving [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) news through people racing to be the first one to publish the clickbait-type of tweet.
I used to have energy to be part of that race and not suffering from [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), but it's become unsustainable for me －
it's not just anxiety,
I feel that I'm wasting my time watching or reading about _"the new things"_, even if I don't really need them.

In the past few months, I've worked on turning things around in the way I consume tech.
Rather than letting my excitement decide where to spend my time,
I consume the content as I need it for my day-to-day tasks.
For example,
reading about people talking about [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/),
especially now around WWDC,
made me feel that I should read and talk about it too.
However,
a more thorough thinking stopped me from doing it.
I used that time to learn things that I might need for improving [Tuist](https://tuist.io),
which is what I enjoy working on these days.

It's a uncomfortable stance at first,
but I believe in its long-term benefits in my mental health.
Being ok with not knowing about what was presented during WWDC allows me to use my time more wisely and have a mental space that otherwise I wouldn't have.
