Working on building tools for developers has helped me realize that what I like even more than coding is going through the product thinking process.
That's why I'm so engaged building [Tuist](https://tuist.io),
and recently [Galaxy](https://building.appgalaxy.io).

I used to be excited by playing with technology itself.
_SwiftUI?_ Oh! I want to test that out and see how it feels.
_A new reactive framework?_ I want to add it to my app and see how it compares to RxSwift.
However, that's no longer the case.
I see technology as a mean provide something to the users and tackle problems/needs they might have.
And the side effect of this shift is that I don't worry anymore about having to keep up with the latest with the latest.
Instead, my focus is on users, **what do they need?**

I enjoy seeing how developers work at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) and wondering what kind of tools we could build to help them.
I also enjoy seeing developers joining [Tuist's Slack group](https://slack.tuist.io) and bring new interesting challenges I didn't think about before.

These are questions that I often ask myself:

- How can I make convenient inconvenient steps of developing apps with Xcode?
- How should Tuist's website design be to convey the ideas behind the project?
- What can I do to build a healthy and engaging community of users?
- What can I do to reach those developers that still struggle to scale up their Xcode projects?
- How can I solve challenging problems like reliable team signing of apps or faster builds?
- How can I make sure we don't disregard little details that make the user experience using Tuist great?

In a recent interview at Shopify, someone asked me what I like from my job.
I did not expect that question,
but I could answer it without thinking twice:
**I like to make complex things simple.**

That's what I've enjoyed doing at Shopify and with Tuist,
and that I'll continue exploring further in the next few years.

By the way, I just got a book on [Web Typography](https://abookapart.com/products/on-web-typography) because I want to understand how different typographies influence the way a design is perceived.
