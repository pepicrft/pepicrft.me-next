Today I created an [RFC](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/318) for the first time in the repository ðŸ¥³. I've pondering a bunch of ideas for a long time regarding how the experience building React Native apps could be improved and I finally gave them a structure and formalized them in a RFC.

I'm not sure if the community will be willing to embrace that direction, but I'm convinced the developer experience can improve significantly. It reminds me to the moment I had the realization that [Tuist](https://tuist.io) was necessary and I set out to build it.
