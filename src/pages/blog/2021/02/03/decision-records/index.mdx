One of the things I've been terrible at is at **keeping decisions records in projects**.
It happens often working on Tuist that I come across something that I need to know why it was done in a particular way and I can't remember.
It also happens that users ask about something and I have to repeat the same thing over an over.
Because of that, I'm considering adding a decision record to the Tuist repository where we can keep track of these things,
as well to the repos at Shopify that my team is responsible for maintaining.

As a developers **we have to make many decisions along the day**,
and the result of those decisions is most of the times code.
However, if the code doesn't speak for itself,
it's extremely useful to add a companion narrative that adds the context necessary to understand the story of the code.
It takes practice to build this habit,
but I think it's an important one to build as you become a more senior engineer.
Piling up undocumented decisions in a project is the perfect recipe for misunderstandings and frustration.

I'm working on building that habit and making decision records a core piece of every repository that I'm responsible for maintaining.
