I became weirdly excited for Rust lately. It's a programming language that I've been planning to learn for some time and I finally set out to learn it.

It's just the beginning of my learning process but I have to say I like the openness of its community and tooling, and the interesting concepts such as ownership that come with it. Swift feels authoritarian and constrained by Apple after getting immersed in Rust. I also like about it that you can easily do cross-platform compilation and use the editor of your choice. Let's see how it goes, but I think it'll become my go-to compiled programming language over Swift. Using it is so liberating and you can feel it's purely community driven.
