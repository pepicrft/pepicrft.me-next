As you might know,
[Shopify](https://shopify.com) allowed me to try the people management track and become an engineering manager.
I've been doing that for the past two years.
Along the process I learned a lot and made so many mistakes and I don't regret having given it a shot.
In hindsight, I think the experience will help me be a better engineer.

This post is a **list in no particular** order of the things that I learned and experienced:

- People are unpredictable.
- Management work is hard to measure. You can't count it and it's hard to reflect on it.
- Achieving a balanced team state is an impossible task because of external factors that you don't control: _reorganizations, people leaving, priority shifts._
- A team larger than 5 people is not a good idea. Your management starts to suffer and your team notices it.
- Exiting someone from the company is tough.
- Being recognized for your work is unusual, but when it happens and it comes from your reports, it's very rewarding.
- Sometimes you don't have answers for all the questions, and that's fine. You need to be comfortable being in that situation.
- Seeing people leaving is sad. It's hard to to wonder if you could have done things better.
- It's great seeing people progressing in their career and growing the impact of their contributions.
- A road map you come up with today won't be valid in a few weeks from today. The world is dynamic, so is the company and its priorities.
- Reorganizations are sometimes hard to digest. When they happen people move around, other people leave, and you have new objectives you have to accommodate to.
- Context switching is an important skill to have. You mustn't let it make you a zombie at the end of the day.
- The role of business partner is crucial to find answers to your questions and provide guidance when necessary.
- Getting feedback from other managers when doing impact reviews is very useful.

And at this point you might wonder what led me to go back to individual contributor.
I enjoy **building**.
I enjoy opening my laptop, putting my headphones on, and creating things with code.
I do that with [Tuist](https://tuist.io) and I used to that before taking the manager role.
I also like mentoring people through working together in problems.
That's how I met [Marek](https://twitter.com/marekfort), who recently joined the organization.

Shopify is a great place to grow as a manager.
You have great tools and excellent managers you can learn from.
There's even a framework to ensure management is consistent across the organization.
However,
and as I mentioned earlier,
my path is on the technical track,
and I'd like to continue solving problems with code.
