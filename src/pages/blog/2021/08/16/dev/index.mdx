One of the things that I appreciate as a developer is having a **consistent experience across projects**.
As you probably know,
this is often not the case when running a project locally.
Some ask you to run `yarn run ios`.
Others prefer an executable like `bin/rails server` instead.
This adds friction when changing when jumping between projects.
**Can we mitigate the friction?**

This is something I'm changing in my projects with an executable called `dev`.
All my projects have it going forward.
That's the only thing I have to remember.

Since I have Ruby in most of my projects,
I leverage [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) and a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) to run concurrent processes.
This is an example of the `Procfile.dev` of one of my Rails projects:

```
rails: bin/rails server
vite: bin/vite dev
```

Then all I need in the `dev` executable is:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

bundle exec foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

It'd be great if I could have an `up` command too to configure the environment.
However,
and as you might know,
configuring environments deterministically and reliably is hard.
Many companies let that be a developer's responsibility.
Others like Shopify have needed years to have a tool that does an incredibly good job at that.
And companies like GitHub,
prefer to take the development to [the cloud](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
