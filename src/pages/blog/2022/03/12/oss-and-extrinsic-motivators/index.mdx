More and more,
we see **open-source projects being backed by investment rounds**. It's positive for the projects because they can innovate faster and sustain themselves by paying people to work on it full-time, making money one of the main drivers, and investors’ interests the wheel that steers the boat.
_Is that something good or bad?_ It depends.

When the motivations of the people contributing to a project are [extrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive_theories:_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation), then the chances are that when money is gone, so are the motivations to contribute to the project. When the project is more community-driven, intrinsic motivations take preference, which helps the project sustain long-term. Note that community involvement and governance are not the same, even though they are often used interchangeably.

There’s a **high correlation between projects that use money as an extrinsic motivator and the amount of marketing effort they’ve poured into them**. They usually have marketing copies along the lines of _“we are making the web faster”_ that reassemble the missions from Silicon Valley companies. I refrain from building anything upon those tools and frameworks no matter how good their marketing is. When I build software, I want it to sustain in time, and to achieve that, it’s important that the blocks I build it upon can sustain too.

Note that there’ll always be economic interests when developing open-source projects. Companies contribute to open-source projects because they benefit their business. However, **money here is a secondary player**. The community has a substantial role in steering the project than the companies that support the project through contributions.
An excellent example of this is Rails.
A company like [Shopify](https://shopify.com) has teams dedicated to contributing to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
Shopify has interests, but it can't drive the framework in a direction that only benefits Shopify.

I think this is beautiful about the Ruby community,
and recently in Javascript through projects like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
You can sense a community behind it that connects all the different pieces in harmony and builds a strong community around it.
This is the type of OSS that aligns with my principles and upon which I build the software that I craft.
