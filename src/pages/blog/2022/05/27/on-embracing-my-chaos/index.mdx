Over the past few years, I’ve tried and failed many times at giving my chaotic self some order — **something that inevitably made me feel anxious**.

I tried to organize myself using todo apps. I always used any random piece of paper that I found near me. I also tried to file, categorize, and prioritize issues on a GitHub repository. Still, I ended up resorting to a .gitignored `TODO.md` document. My note-taking apps are a mess. Thinking about how to label and organize my notes is an unnecessary mental burden for me. When something pops in my head, I want to jot it down and move on.

A caveat to my chaos is that it is **not very compatible when collaborating with other people**, for example, at work or doing open source. Some level structure is necessary for coordination to happen. Because of that, I sometimes pause, reflect, and give my chaos some structure to work with others toward a common goal. It’s not natural to me, but I don’t know about a better way. For example, I write up project roadmaps and visions, capture ideas or bugs on GitHub issues, or do brain dumps in the shape of blog posts. I did a lot of those when I maintained [Tuist](https://tuist.io), and it had a positive on the community we were able to build around the tool.

I **embraced chaos** as one of my traits to mitigate the bits of anxiety that structuring the chaos brought me. Moreover, I adopted a tool like Logseq that allows me to capture the chaos in a raw state and defer giving some shape later. I usually do the latter if it’s essential to be able to get back to in the future or if it’s something that I plan to share with others.
