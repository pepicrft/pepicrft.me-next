Since I distanced myself from iOS development and [Tuist](https://tuist.io), it’s been a time of lacking a sense of identity and belonging. I’ve done a lot of Ruby when building tools for mobile developers, Typescript in the [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/shopify/cli). On the side, I’ve been learning but not using Elixir and Rust. I don’t consider myself a developer of any of those languages, which is something positive from the versatility point of view. However, it’s created this weird sense that I don’t know my identity in the programming context. Because of it, I’ve been going back and forth in my spare time between ideas for things I could build to connect with one programming language and find that identity I feel I’m lacking. This, indeed, made me feel anxious. If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pepicrft), you’ve probably sensed it. I’m aware of it, and I’m working on not re-programming, seeking an identity in the tools (programming languages) I use, and instead finding it in the things that bring me joy. For example, in hobbies or cool ideas to play with no other goal than having fun. We’ll see how it goes.
