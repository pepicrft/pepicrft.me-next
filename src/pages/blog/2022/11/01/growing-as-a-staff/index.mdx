A couple of months ago, I reached [Shopify](https://shopify.com)'s Senior Staff Developer level. They were exciting news and excellent proof that Shopify continues to be a place for growth. Yet they pushed me out of my comfort zone, throwing me into a new realm of responsibilities.

Settling into the new role **is taking me some time**. One reason is that I'm going through a process of accepting the change. My new role is less about being hands-on with coding solutions and more about the business. It's about reading, writing, talking, and socializing change in the organization. It's familiar, but I'm not as fluent and comfortable as I wish. Being in front of people and presenting an idea still feels terrifying.

**Excellent communication skills** are essential for this role, and mines have a lot of room for improvement. Therefore, I started working on them. I'm writing more regularly now and reading more slowly. While I do, I pay attention to how ideas are structured and connected. As someone with [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), focusing on a lengthy text piece feels painful. I also scheduled regular chats with people from other teams and leaders. The aim of these conversations is to have a more holistic view of the organization and its direction. This is useful to spot opportunities to support the organization best.

There are so many unknowns ahead of me, but it's part of playing the [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game) of the software craft. This as an excellent opportunity to grow professionally and personally. And I'm fortunate to do it surrounded by many talented people I can learn from.
