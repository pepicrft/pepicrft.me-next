While building [Gestalt](https://github.com/gestaltjs), I realized that many web frameworks don’t move away from [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) because their usage of modules in [ESM](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) would lead to a slower hot-reloading experience. This is primarily due to how module graphs are loaded with ESM – the entire graph needs to be fully loaded before the code starts executing. Imagine how slow hot-reloading would be if that had to happen every time we changed a file.
Solving it would be doing **dynamic imports** in development or static ones in production. This can be achieved through a build process that is environment-aware.

```js
// Static ESM imports
import { loadRoutes } from "gestaltjs/routes"

// Dynamic ESM imports
function doSomething() {
  const { loadRoutes } = await import("gestaltjs/routes")
}
```
