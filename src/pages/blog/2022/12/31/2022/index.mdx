It's December 31st, 2022, and unlike other years, this year's end-of-the-year blog post will be concise.
2022 has gone smoothly, and I've been lucky not to have been directly impacted by the craziness in which the world finds itself.
I traveled to [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) for the first time and visited [Indonesia](https://bali.com) for the second one.
[Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) became the programming language I use daily, and I got promoted to Senior Staff Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com).
I learned a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and went back and forth between a few ideas for building something in my spare time.
One of the ideas was Gestalt,
a Javascript framework whose development I halted.
I returned to German lessons in the second half of the year, and with my wife, we often wondered what's next in our lives: _Is Berlin the place where we want to live forever?_
My family and I are healthy and have traveled with my parents for the first time to the Alps.

**What do I expect from 2023?**
Less craziness in this world.
Fewer wars, less financial instability, and overall more humanity.
I'll continue investing in learning German and in myself.
In the past few years, I disregarded working out quite a lot, so I'd like to get back to running more regularly.
With my wife, I want to find an answer for what's next in our lives.
We've been playing with the idea of living for a few years in New York,
but there's a lot to figure out there.
And last but not least,
I'd like to build an additional source of income to retire my parents early.
They became slaves of a badly-run family business that barely gives them time off to enjoy with us.

And you, what are your plans for 2023?
