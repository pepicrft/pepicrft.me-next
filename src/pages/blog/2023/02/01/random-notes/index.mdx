I'm back in Berlin after more than a month in my hometown in Spain — we went there for Christmas and decided to stay longer. The return felt great because it meant restarting Berlin's routines and lifestyle. It also meant having a gray sky every day, but since I came back with the Vitamine D Batteries charged, I'm able to cope with it. I hope it'll last.

I built a weekly routine around **German lessons**, giving me the confidence I never had. I dare to start a conversation and survive through it. I don't know why using the language has always felt so daunting. It's me fighting with my perfectionism.
At home, we are considering continuing with the apartment's furnishing. It's still half-furnished and doesn't feel as cozy as it could. This work will keep us entertained during the remaining winter months.

At work, I'm still **struggling with how I balance my energy**. E-commerce moves fast so does the development of the tools that enable it. Shopify is mindful of it and provides us with the resources. Still, at the end of the day, it's on us to put limits, and working from home doesn't help:

- Minor problems become significant.
- The brain blurs the gap between personal and professional thinking.
- The latter ends up conquering the majority of my thinking energy.

I've also been inspired by [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)'s approach to design tools and some of the challenges the localization industry faces, which I learned through my wife, to embark with her on making localization social and more open through a hub, [Gesttalt](https://github.com/gesttalt). We plan to build it on GitHub and OSS' values and ideas. We can positively impact the industry and give translators' roles the visibility they deserve.

And that's it for this journal entry. I plan to write more regularly to structure my thoughts and ideas.
