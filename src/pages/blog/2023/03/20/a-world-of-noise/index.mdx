The world is accelerating, and with it, the amount of information we are presented with. Because humans have a limited attention span, we are developing many tricks and silver-bullet tools to master productivity. We are treating ourselves as robots, which has a cost: an increase in stress levels and everything that derives from it.

I feel part of the trend and wouldn’t say I like it. On one side, I must keep up with everything being discussed publicly via various platforms (Twitter, RSS, LinkedIn…). Not doing it comes with the fear of losing competency in a world that prizes productivity and being up-to-date. The consequences of doing it are constant comparisons with others and energy-draining, which leaves me with no energy for myself at the end of the day. My attention span also diminishes, and I struggle to read long texts.

On the other side, I feel that I have to contribute to it; I mustn’t be quiet. Everyone tries to be loud with their argument and ideas, and I want to be part of that noise. It is connected to a widespread phenomenon of “being an influencer.” There’s an audience of followers that you have gained over time and that you have to feed with the most creative content you can think of. In the end, you are not the smartest, you are the loudest, and you spend your entire life seeking recognition from others. It’s dumb when you think about it.

I want to regain control over my time and life. It’s been enough of consuming and producing noise on the Internet. I’ll work on ignoring the noise and eliminate the feeling id having to participate in it. I’ll continue writing here because I’m not pushing content onto people’s feeds if they happen to come across this blog post and extract something valuable from it; great. If they don’t, that’s fine too.
